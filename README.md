Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

The client was Artemis Financial and they wanted to insure that the data they were transfering and modifing was protected and encrypted to prevent cyber attacks and leaks.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I was able to identiy false security threats that are easy to secure by simple updating files. It is important to code securely because it keep important data protected which for a business, data protection is a high demand requirment to the success of a business.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
Properly pluggin in the spring boot code to run the dependency check to a little time to get right so that the code would not fail on the build. Applying standards and remebering to close the function helped fix the check issues I faced.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

Assessing vulnerabilities and deciding which mitigation techniques to use typically involves a risk-based approach. Organizations assess the severity and likelihood of potential vulnerabilities and prioritize mitigation efforts based on these factors. They may also consider legal and compliance requirements when making security decisions. Additionally, organizations often follow best practices and frameworks like NIST, ISO 27001, and CIS to guide their security strategies.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

It's important to adopt a security-focused mindset during development, and secure coding practices, such as input validation, output encoding, and proper access controls, should be applied consistently to reduce the likelihood of introducing vulnerabilities during refactoring or development.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I used integrated Development Environments and security scanners such as OWASP to mitigate security vulnerabilities. Using theses will help create secure programs in the future.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I would show my assessment report because it show all the different security messures I went through in a easy to read report.
